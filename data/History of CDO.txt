CDO Food Products, Inc. began as a mom-and-pop shop on June 25, 1975, when dietitian Corazon Dayro-Ong started selling homemade meat products from her family’s residence in Valenzuela. With a modest loan from a rural bank and a simple dream, she and her husband turned their lot into a meat processing plant.

In 1981, they changed the business name to Foodsphere Inc., with CDO as the flagship brand for its wide range of meat products. About a decade later, the company bought a patch of land and built its first modern factory. Growing the company came with many challenges, including a fire in their factory and a financial crisis in the 1990s. But “we survived every crisis as a family,” shares Corazon, referring to the employees of Foodsphere as well.

With the Ong children taking their places in the family business, the company steadily rose to become a market leader in the food industry. Foodsphere’s plants in Valenzuela and in Batangas now produce food brands that have become Filipino household favorites: CDO Karne Norte, Funtastyk Young Pork Tocino, San Marino Corned Tuna, Idol Cheesedog, CDO Premium Holiday Ham, and Danes Cheese.

From a homemaker’s dream of providing good food for her family, Foodsphere has grown to an enterprise that provides quality products to millions of Filipino families and helps uplift the Philippine economy. But Corazon continues to guide the company as she has done from the beginning: With the knowledge and expertise of a dietitian who constantly creates nutritious, quality, and affordable food for the Filipino; and with the heart of a mother who gathers families round the table, with food that makes mealtime more delicious and more meaningful.
