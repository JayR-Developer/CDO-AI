THE LEADER'S PLAYBOOK
 THE LEADER'S PLAYBOOK
 A Leader’s Toolkit to Managing Employee Experience
My Dearest Leaders,
 Greetings!
 When I first dreamt of starting my own business, I was inspired by the love that I have for my family more than
 anything else. I never imagined that such a simple dream would one day turn into a bigger reality - becoming
 one of the largest food enterprises in the Philippines. Now, it has become a home to other families as well. Ever
 since, we have treated our employees as an extension of our own family. I always believe that when we are
 able to look after their welfare, they will in turn take care of our business and treat it as their own. 
It is for this reason that I urge each one of you to lead your team with the same passion, understanding, and
 vigor as you do your job. As leaders, you play a vital role in helping us make this home flourish. Your
 leadership should inspire your people to be better in what they do believing that it will fulfill their own sense of
 purpose. I trust that you will be our partner in nurturing the people that we have and in continuously making
 their stay in our home a truly meaningful one. 
Let this playbook be your tool in guiding your people in their journey here in CDO. We depend on you in
 creating a prosperous home as we continue to remain relevant and evolve as a family that serves a bigger
 community.
 Together, let us strengthen our bond as a family, as one Ka-Republika so that with One Heart and in One Home
 we will be able to fulfill our purpose and thrive as One CDO, continuously serving our customers and
 consumers with food that brings them Home.
 Corazon Dayro-Ong
 Founder & Chairman
The Leader's Playbook is a comprehensive but easy-to-use manual
 that provides guidelines for leaders like you on managing your staff's
 employee experience using the current HR processes and tools.  
This playbook offers the support that you need to carry out your role as a leader,
 arranged based on the employee’s life cycle within the organization.  It has been
 divided into the following phases: Attract, Onboard, Engage, Develop, and
 Offboard, each containing the relevant principles, guidelines, tools, and processes
 you need to know.  
Icons and underlined words or phrases that are clickable are
 embedded in this toolkit to help in the ease of navigation.      
Although this playbook intends to help you lead effectively, it does not guarantee to
 have all the answers.  In situations that are extraordinarily complex, unusual, or new,
 it is still recommended to work with or consult your HR Business Partner. 
You are expected to be fully oriented with the contents of this playbook. Should
 there be any changes in the HR standards and guidelines and any other related
 information that will not be immediately reflected in the playbook, the Company,
 through Corporate HRAD, will make sure to notify its employees.
A meaningful employee experience in CDO should
 look and feel like HOME
 "This looks like a
 place I can call
 home."
 "Indeed, it feels
 like home!"
 "Given my
 capabilities, I know
 how I can contribute
 to this household,
 and I am empowered
 to do so."
 "This home supports
 my personal and
 professional
 growth."
 "I will always look at
 CDO as my home."
 A meaningful employee experience in CDO can be likened to
 finding a place called "HOME" where one's capabilities are
 valued, recognized, and maximized throughout the
 employee's stay.  Key to this experience is the leader's
 support, participation, and guidance.

 prospective candidates by preparing well.

A job interview is a conversation that occurs
 between a potential employer and a job applicant,
 where the employer has the opportunity to
 assess and appraise the qualifications and
 general fitness of the applicant for the job
 opening.  
The objective of an interview is to know the
 applicant more by gathering information about
 his/her profile, competencies, and work experience
 (if applicable) and use them against the defined
 selection criteria to be able to choose the most
 qualified candidate.

 documentation
 Choose the best candidate for the job
 It is important for leaders (as interviewers) to prepare well for the
 interview in order to facilitate a smooth process. 
Preparation includes coordinating with the concerned authorities,
 setting the most appropriate schedule and venue, and visualizing the
 interview proper, i.e. what questions to ask, how to open and close
 the interview, etc.
 Your Goal as a Leader Your Goal as a Leader
 Whenever you conduct an
 interview, you represent FSI. A
 good interview experience for
 the candidate will leave a
 positive impression for the
 Company even if no job offer
 will be made in the end.
 However, a bad interview may
 result in a bad image for the
 Company, which can be shared by
 the applicant through friends,
 relatives, and social media. 
Onboard Engage Offboard Develop Attract
Preparing for the Interview
 Preparing for the Interview
 Review the job description. Identify the
 competencies to describe the desired candidate
 (experience, knowledge, education, and intellectual,
 interpersonal, and motivational competencies). This is
 your job/candidate profile.
 Review each candidate's resume. Select those who
 best match your job/candidate profile for interview.
 Inform or arrange an interview schedule with the
 candidate through the Recruitment team. Ensure that
 the interview will be conducted in a quiet and private
 place, free of distractions and interruptions (applies
 whether the interview will be held virtually or in
 person). Do not be late in the interview schedule.
 Allot a maximum of one (1) hour for the interview.

 Prepare interview questions or check out guide
 questions to allow a smooth flow of conversation with
 the candidate. Ask questions that draw out the
 candidate's competencies in relation to the
 competencies necessary to effectively perform the
 job.
 Review the candidate's resume and supporting
 materials shortly before the interview to refresh your
 memory.
 After the interview, record your evaluation and
 recommendation in the interview evaluation form that
 will be provided by the Recruitment team or, in the
 absence of an evaluation form, prepare your own
 interview rating sheet.

Conducting the Interview
 Conducting the Interview
 Set the interview climate
 Choose a schedule and a venue that will allow you to conduct the
 interview with no distractions or interruptions. BE ON TIME! This
 applies even if the interview will be conducted online. Focusing on
 the applicant will allow you to gather as much information as you
 need as well as fairly assess his/her qualifications.
 Establish rapport with the applicant
 Try to put the applicant at ease - greet them with a warm friendly
 smile, introduce yourself, shake their hands (if face-to-face), and
 ask simple questions like, “How was your day?”, “Have you had a
 hard time finding our office?”
 Set the agenda
 Describe the interview structure, i.e. how the interview will
 proceed, who will be involved (if it’s a panel).
 Ask questions
 Begin with relatively simple questions based on information
 included in the applicant’s CV or resume. Then focus on
 behavioral-based questions that will allow the applicant to talk
 about his/her previous experiences and achievements.

 Take notes
 This will help you ask follow-up questions and recall specific details
 about the applicant. Notes need not be verbatim; key words or
 phrases will do.
 Listen carefully
 Do not anticipate the answers of the applicant. Reserve judgment
 until after the applicant has finished answering.
 Maintain control
 If the applicant gets off-track, ask a specific question that will bring
 him/her back to the interview.
 Allow opportunity for questions
 Before ending the interview, give the applicant the opportunity to
 ask questions and try to answer them to the best of your
 knowledge. Do not give false or incomplete information.
 Close the interview
 Ask whether the candidate has anything more to tell you or any
 questions. Explain the next step in the process. Thank the
 candidate. Complete your notes and/or rating sheet (if any).

Behavioral-based Interview
 Behavioral-based Interview
 Behavioral interview is a structured interviewing approach that
 focuses on asking questions to identify past behaviors and
 successes that closely relate to situations the candidates will
 encounter in the job for which they have applied for. This is based
 on the premise that past behavior is the most accurate predictor of
 future behavior. 
The candidate has the opportunity to demonstrate their potential
 for succeeding in the new job by providing concrete examples of
 how they used specific behaviors or skills to handle certain
 situations based on their past experience. This helps the
 interviewer get an accurate picture of not only what the candidate
 can do, but how they do it.

 A: Action ask about the actions taken to handle the situation and
 overcome the challenge
 "What steps did you take?", "What decisions

 effective?"
 R: Result ask to describe the outcome of the action and its impact "What was the result of your actions?"
 Part of behavioral interviewing is the use of the STAR method, which was introduced by Development Dimensions International (DDI),
 an international human resources and leadership development consultancy. The STAR method helps one capture complete
 information about how someone has performed on the job. It is one of the simplest and most effective ways to communicate in an
 interview or even when providing feedback.
 Using this method in a behavioral interview allows the candidate to tell stories about themselves based on past experiences and
 behavior, which will help you draw better conclusions about their skill and job fit.

 ONBOARDING
 Onboarding is the process of facilitating all necessary organizational
 actions that support new employee integration and help them function in
 their role effectively within the organization.  It occurs in the period
 between offer acceptance until full integration into the CDO family.  This
 stage is critical because as early as Day 1, new hires are already
 imagining how their life is going to be during their stay in the
 organization.

structured onboarding program not only
 increases employee retention, but also plays a
 vital role in building positive organizational
 culture. By making a proper and positive
 impression, employees will more likely stay
 and be a productive member of the

 PROBATIONARY
 PERIOD
 DAYS
 The first one hundred eighty days of a new
 employee is considered as the most critical
 period in his/her employment as it would
 determine his/her success in the organization in
 terms of job and culture fit.  The probationary
 period helps employers observe the skills,
 competence, and performance of new employees
 and determine if they are able to meet the
 reasonable standards to become regular or
 permanent employees. 
In order to do this, the leader should develop
 performance goals and expectations, observe
 and provide regular feedback, and set aside
 ample time to discuss and evaluate the
 employee’s performance.

 During the probationary period of the new employee, your role is to monitor and review
 his/her performance based on the goals and expectations that were set and agreed upon
 since the first day of employment.
 On the 3rd Month
 It is recommended that you conduct a mid
point performance evaluation to determine
 whether the new employee is meeting
 performance standards.  It does not have to
 be through a formal performance evaluation,
 but you should have some form of
 documentation. 
Conducting a mid-point performance review
 allows the new employee the opportunity to
 make changes and improvements in his/her
 performance in the succeeding months
 before the 5th month performance

 you should immediately accomplish the
 Performance Evaluation Form (PEF). You
 should be able to submit it on the 5th month
 with a decision on whether or not to
 regularize the employee. 
When the employment is not terminated after
 the 180-day probationary period, it shall then
 be considered regular employment.
 Offboard
 Under Article 281 of the Labor Code of the
 Philippines, the maximum length of
 probationary employment shall be 180
 days, and is counted from the date an
 employee started working, unless it is
 covered by an apprenticeship agreement
 stipulating a longer period. The services of
 an employee who has been engaged on a
 probationary basis may be terminated
 for a just cause or when he fails to
 qualify as a regular employee in
 accordance with reasonable standards
 made known by the employer to the
 employee at the time of his engagement.

Can the probationary period be extended?
 FAQs
 FAQs
 No. Under normal circumstances, the probationary period of an employee should not be extended. The
 six months probationary period given to the new employee is considered as sufficient time for the
 employer and the new employee to determine if they have a good fit. However, exceptions may be
 made in very rare cases or under instances when complete evaluation of the employee’s performance
 will not be possible. For emphasis, the extension must be done in good faith, with justification, and
 must be agreed upon by both the employer and employee. This should be approved by the Division
 Head and the HRAD Head.
 Can a new employee be regularized prior to the regularization period?
 No. Early regularization is discouraged unless under extreme circumstances.
 Is there a salary increase upon regularization?
 It is not automatic or guaranteed. However, in rare cases, a minimal adjustment may be recommended by the immediate superior or manager.
 How do we count the probationary period?
 The probationary period begins from the time the employee started working, not on when he/she signed the job offer or the employment
 contract. The probationary period of 6 months is equal to 180 days.
 What happens if I was unable to submit the necessary documents past the new employee's probationary period?
 The new employee automatically becomes a regular employee regardless of the result of the performance evaluation due to technicality.

Why is Employee
 Engagement Important?
 Employees are more engaged when they feel that their
 work is positive and fulfilling. They feel proud of, inspired
 by, and actively involved with their work. They also feel
 that their employers listen to and care for them.
 Without employee engagement, there is no team
 engagement making it difficult to improve business
 outcomes. 
Through effective employee engagement initiatives and
 programs, employees will bring unique benefits to the
 organization in the form of higher profitability, better
 customer retention, better talent acquisition and
 retention, lower employee turnover, and a safer work
 environment.
 “Employee engagement cannot be
 a strategy because engagement
 comes from within the employee.
 It’s the emotional connection or
 commitment that an employee has
 to the organization that then
 causes the employee to want to put
 forth the additional effort to ensure
 the organization and the brand
 succeed.”- Annette Franz, Founder
 and CEO of CX Journey,
 Inc.
 DID YOU KNOW?
 In a 2017 study by Gallup, it was found that only 15 percent of the
 world’s one billion workers are engaged at work. That’s an
 alarming statistic. Lower engagement leads to lower productivity
 and thus, slower economic growth.
 Employee engagement leads to +42% in commitment, +38% in
 employee retention, and +25% in customer focus.

What is Performance Management?
 As a leader, your responsibility is to develop a high
 performance culture at FSI by ensuring the following:
 Communicate FSI’s mission, goals, and values to
 your team
 Clearly define the work standards and expectations
 with your team and individual members
 Track and analyse performance data
 Conduct regular feedback with your team to keep
 them informed about their progress towards the
 achievement of goals
 Provide guidance and corrective actions for non
achievement of goals or performance expectations
 Communicate and establish a shared belief with
 regard to the importance of continuously improving
 performance
 Performance Management System is the continuous
 process of improving performance by setting
 individual and team goals that are aligned to the
 strategic goals of the organization, planning
 performance to achieve goals, reviewing and
 assessing progress, and developing the knowledge,
 skills, and abilities of people.
 It is an ongoing process of communication between
 a superior and a subordinate that happens
 throughout the year. It involves a continuous process
 of clarifying expectations, setting objectives,
 identifying goals, providing feedback, and reviewing
 results/outputs.

 Strong performance management rests on the

 In an ideal system, a business creates a cascade
 of metrics and targets, from its top-level
 strategic objectives down to the daily activities of
 its frontline employees. Managers continually
 monitor those metrics and regularly engage with
 their teams to discuss progress in meeting the
 targets. Good performance is rewarded;
 underperformance triggers action to address the

Cascading of BSC Cascading of BSC
 Cascading a balanced scorecard means to
 translate  the corporate-wide scorecard starting
 from the top and rolling down into a department,
 group, and even up to the employee level.
 Cascading strategy focuses the entire
 organization on strategy and creating the
 connection between the work people do and high
 level desired results.  As the management system
 is cascaded down through the organization,
 objectives become more operational and tactical,
 as do the performance measures.  Accountability
 follows the objectives and measures, as
 ownership is defined at each level.  This alignment
 step is critical to becoming a strategy-focused
 organization.

 things like new market development, number of sales calls
 made, calories consumed per day, and safety training.
 Lags are things like revenue, profit, quality, accident rate, and
 customer satisfaction. They are called lags because by the
 time you see them, the performance that drove them has
 already passed. You can do nothing to fix them.
 Should be checked more often since they may change
 rapidly. Consider putting them in a dashboard so you can
 track them in real time on a daily or weekly basis.
 Take a long time to change so there's no need to track them
 on a daily or weekly basis. They can be checked less
 frequently, monthly or quarterly, depending on the metric.

 leader to do more, and instead, focus on less so that your team can achieve more."

 LEAD and LAG Measures
 Onboard Engage Offboard Develop Attract
Sample BSC using LEAD-LAG
 It has been customary for businesses to
 just use lagging indicators to measure
 success. However, since it takes a long
 time to see results and it prohibits
 teams to make the necessary ongoing
 adjustments, it has been recommended
 to use a combination of lead and lag
 measures. 
Using lead and lag indicators result in
 enhanced business performance
 overall.  Inasmuch as a Balanced
 Scorecard requires a ‘balance’ of
 measures across organizational
 disciplines, so a ‘balance’ of lead and
 lag indicators are required to ensure
 the right activities are in place to
 guarantee the right outcomes.

 Performance Management begins with a planning
 session wherein goals, Key Result Areas (KRA), Key
 Performance Indicators (KPI), targets, and work
 standards are established and mutually agreed upon
 by the immediate superior and the subordinate.
 Performance expectations is a combination of Results and
 Actions & Behaviors. Results are often measured based on
 the established standards and objectives, while Actions &
 Behaviors can be measured through performance
 dimensions. It is important that the performance expectations
 are written, verifiable, and mutually understood by both the
 immediate superior and the employee. 
Purpose of a written performance expectations:
 Serves as an objective and tangible basis in discussing
 performance
 Allows the employee to distinguish between acceptable
 and unacceptable results or work output
 Increases job satisfaction since employees are aware
 when tasks performed or results meet expectations

I. Key Result Area (KRA)
 I. Key Result Area (KRA)
 KEY RESULT AREAS (KRAs) refer to the general
 areas of outcomes or outputs for which a role,
 or a combination of roles, is responsible. These
 are the main goals which are critical for an
 organization or employee to achieve to be
 successful. KRAs will differ significantly
 depending on the role of an employee or the
 specific goals of a department or an organization.
 KRA answers the questions: 
“What must be measured?” 
“What does success look like for the employee/
 department/organization?”
 “What is the relatively small portion of your work that
 brings the most value to your organization?”
 The KRA for an organization should focus on the vital areas
 that fit best with an organization’s strategic goals and most
 directly drive its success. An organization’s KRAs will vary
 depending on the organization. But, several broad areas are
 a part of KRAs for many organizations. They may include the
 following:

 Begin with a conversation. It is crucial for an immediate superior to meet
 and discuss with the employee in preparing and writing the KRA for the
 position. This is an opportunity for both parties to consider and agree on
 the appropriate goals that will be measured for the position. 
Broadly define the job profile. KRAs should be able to give a general
 description of the job and clarity on the role and mission of the employee
 within the organization.
 Create SMART KRAs. KRAs should be Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
 Relevant, and Time-bound.
 Set a limited and realistic number. KRAs refer to the most important
 objectives and should, therefore, be limited to the critical few. A typical
 area targets three to five KRAs. This helps determine the most valuable
 indicators, makes tracking easier, and aids in allocating resources to that
 which will reap the greatest value.
 Put it in writing. KRAs must be written, reviewed, agreed upon, and
 signed by all parties involved.

 that reports to you? 
Why is each staff member employed

 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs) refer to any
 metric/criteria that measures or evaluates the
 performance in the Key Result Areas (KRAs), which
 linked back to the achievement of the department/
 organization objectives, and the achievement of the
 organization’s goals. KPIs can involve sales figures,
 product performance, return on investments, savings,
 and a wide range of other areas that are quantifiable or
 have observable indicators.
 KPI answers the questions:
 How will the KRA be measured?
 How will I assess our progress towards the
 achievement of our goals?
 KPIs can be expressed through the following:
 Timeliness – the amount of time needed to complete
 a certain task or activity; answers the questions: by
 when, how soon, or within what period
 Quantity/Productivity – specifies how much work
 must be completed within a certain period of time
 Quality – describes how well the work must be
 accomplished; specifies accuracy, precision,
 appearance, or effectiveness
 Cost – used when performance can be reviewed in
 terms of utilization of resources: money saved, waste
 reduced, income generated

II. Values: Defining
 Actions and Behaviors
 II. Values: Defining
 Actions and Behaviors
 Performance expectations cannot be satisfied solely
 by results. It is important to consider other aspects of
 performance that will lead to the achievement of
 established objectives and standards, such as actions
 and behaviors. Understanding how employees act
 and behave in order to perform their job is also
 important to success as the end results.
 It is believed that the manner by which employees conduct
 themselves in carrying out their work will largely impact the
 outcome or the results that will be produced. It is therefore vital
 that leaders also focus on and assess the way people go about
 their work.
 As a leader, you should be able to identify and quantify aspects of
 performance to make them specific, observable, job-related, and
 behavioral. You start by defining the job and stating the range of
 behaviors the employees must exhibit to successfully perform the
 job based on expectations and standards. These behaviors may be
 grouped into broad categories called dimensions, which answer the

 deciding factor for his/her regularization. 
You can show and discuss the employee’s rating based on
 actual accomplishments as well as all significant observations
 during the covered evaluation period. The employee will also
 be given the opportunity to respond and propose a plan of

 Performance review is the process of measuring an
 employee’s performance in the current position based on
 the agreed standards and expectations. This is also known
 as appraisal, evaluation, or assessment. 
The performance evaluation summarizes the employee’s
 contribution over the entire review period. Depending on the
 organization’s policy, an employee can be formally assessed
 once or twice a year. However, it is suggested that employees
 receive some form of evaluation or assessment on a more
 frequent basis or as often as necessary.

 Components of Rating
 Employees are rated based on Key Performance Indicators (70%)
 and CDO Values (30%). 
The KPI rating is derived from actual accomplishments/outputs
 versus set targets as agreed by both the immediate superior and
 the employee during the performance planning phase.
 The employee is also evaluated based on certain dimensions and
 indicators in relation to the Company’s core values, each has a
 corresponding qualitative description. The employee will be rated
 according to the degree by which said attributes are being
 exhibited.  Specific critical incidents should be cited. It is
 recommended that the superior maintains a record of work
related behavior, whether positive or negative, demonstrated by
 the employee.

Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
 A Performance Improvement Plan, also known as a performance action
 plan, is a tool to give an employee with performance deficiencies the
 opportunity to succeed. It may be used to address failures to meet
 specific job goals or to ameliorate behavior-related concerns.
 It is a formal document stating any recurring performance issues along
 with goals and specific steps that an employee needs to achieve in order
 to improve his performance and regain good standing at the company,
 usually within a specific timeline. 
This strategy facilitates a constructive discussion between a manager
 and an employee with a higher degree of clarity about specific
 expectations. It also provides a complete documentation of agreements,
 progress, and consequence.
 During the PIP period, the employee should make sure that he meets the
 stated goals within the timeline. He/She should initiate discussion or
 communication with his/her manager at any time throughout the plan.
 Your Role as Leader
 Coordinate with your HRBP when the
 decision to place an employee under PIP
 is made.
 Develop the PIP stating specific goals
 and timelines as well as consequences.
 Discuss the PIP with the employee.
 Monitor and provide regular feedback
 to the employee (midpoint discussion
 and at the end of PIP period).
 Onboard Engage Offboard Develop Attract
While the employee is under PIP, his/her incentive during the
 covered period shall be suspended.
 Consistent failure to meet the performance expectations within
 the PIP period may lead to disciplinary action, up to and
 including termination.
 If the employee shows progress and successfully completes
 the PIP, he/she is expected to maintain an acceptable level of
 performance at all times. Otherwise, he/she may be put on
 another PIP that may lead to disciplinary action, up to and
 including termination. 
Duration of a PIP
 An employee that is place under a PIP will be observed for a
 minimum of 90 days. if the performance did not improve during
 the first 90 days, the PIP can be extended to another 90 days.An
 employee may undergo a PIP for a maximum of 180 days.
 Consequences of a PIP
 Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)
 A PIP is given after an employee receives a poor
 performance review.  Once an employee obtains a
 rating that does not meet expectations/standards,
 he/she may be placed under PIP.

 sign the PIP, you may escalate it to the next level

 The following should be part of the discussion between the manager and the employee who will be placed under PIP. The manager
 should ensure that all the elements are properly filled up and mutually agreed on (refer to the table below). A vital part of the PIP is the
 constant and regular meetings to check on the employee’s progress.
 PIP I is the initial opportunity given to the employee to address
 and improve a performance issue. Both must affix their signature
 on the PIP I letterto indicate that the content of the PIP has been
 reviewed, understood, and discussed by the two parties. A copy of
 the PIP letter must be given to the employee and another copy kept
 in the employee’s 201 File.
 If the employee successfully meets the goals and has shown
 progress during the first 90 days of the PIP, he/she will be removed
 from the program and will be given a PIP Completion Letter.
 However, the employee will have to maintain an acceptable level of performance at all times. Otherwise, he/she will be placed under
 another PIP that may lead to a disciplinary action, up to and including termination.
 PIP II is the last opportunity given to the employee to regain his/her performance in the event that he/she did not successfully
 complete PIP I. The employee will be given another 90 days to meet the stated goals in the PIP within the given timeline. Just like in the
 first PIP, a discussion of the goals will have to be made giving emphasis on the likelihood of the employee being terminated for failure to
 successfully accomplish the objectives that were set under the PIP. This shall be documented using the PIP II Letter.

Constructive Feedback
 Destructive Feedback
 Constructive Feedback
 Constructive feedback is providing useful
 comments and suggestions that contribute
 to a positive outcome, a better process or
 an improved behavior.  It is corrective, but
 not critical.  It always comes with positive
 intentions and is used as a supportive
 communication tool to address specific 
issues or concerns.
 It improves employee morale, positively
 impacts the behavior, reduces confusion
 regarding expectations and current
 performance, provides a new perspective
 and gives valuable insight to the person
 receiving feedback.
 Destructive Feedback
 Destructive feedback points at faults and is a
 direct attack on the individual.  No practical
 advice or supportive feedback is given. 
This is used to hurt people's feelings.  Instead
 of telling the employee what they did well and
 where they went wrong, leaders will just tell
 them that they’re doing a terrible job without
 providing any evidence to support their
 assessments.  Employees exit such
 conversations feeling low and defeated
 without even knowing what they’ve done
 wrong or how they could do better next time.

State the constructive or positive purpose of your feedback. This establishes a common ground
 and shows the employee that your aim is to deal with the problem or issue and help make things
 better. By doing this, it will be most likely to win the acceptance and cooperation of the employee.
 “The reason why I want to discuss this matter with you is
 to help us improve our team’s relationship and get us to
 work more efficiently.”
 Describe specifically and factually what you have observed. This will help establish objectivity
 and avoid the employee from taking a defensive stance.
 “I have observed that in order to avoid conflicts, you and
 your team have clammed up and have kept quiet in all
 our meetings.”
 Describe your reaction. This will allow the employee to see the impact of their actions to you
 and/or to the team or department.
 “I feel that this is causing lack of openness that may
 hinder the team’s ability to address problems and work
 more efficiently.”
 Give the other person the opportunity to respond and get agreement on the issue or problem.
 This will show that you recognize the value of his/her ideas or opinion on the matter and will also
 clarify any misunderstandings or misconceptions.
 “How do you feel about that?” (Wait for a response)
 
“So we agree that this is an issue?”
 Agree on plan of action. Ask and listen first to his/her opinion and plan to resolve the issue or
 problem. This will drive ownership of the proposed solutions and encourage accountability from
 the employee. Once you have exhausted all possible solutions that 
 he/she can think of, give your opinion or input as well. 
“What would you suggest we do to resolve this
 issue?”(Exhaust opinion)
 
“In addition, I would suggest that… Is that OK with you?”
 Summarize what has been discussed and express support. This is a chance to clarify and
 confirm agreements made and emphasize that follow-throughs will be made until the problem or
 issue is resolved. This will also reinforce the constructive intent of your feedback.
 “So we agree that to resolve this issue, we can do the
 following…”
 
“Are these steps OK with you?”

 “Coaching is unlocking a
 person’s potential to
 maximize their own
 performance. It is helping
 them to learn rather than
 teaching them to learn.”- Sir John Whitmore, Pioneer of Coaching &
 Leadership Development
 Put simply, coaching is a process that aims to improve
 performance and focuses on the ‘here and now’ rather
 than the distant past or future. 
Good coaches believe that the individual always has
 the answer to their own problems but understands
 that they may need help to find the answer. Thus, the
 coach is not considered as an expert but as a facilitator of
 learning.

 In the book “The Inner Game of Tennis” by Timothy Gallwey, he wrote, “Every
 game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game. The former
 is played with against opponents, and is filled with a lot of contradictory
 advice; the latter is played not against, but within the mind of the player, and
 its principal obstacles are self-doubt, insecurities, lapses in concentration, and
 anxiety.” His insight was that coaches could help individuals to improve their
 game by distracting them from their inner dialogue. 
As Gallwey describes it, a tennis coach who wants his students to feel that the
 cost of the lesson is worthwhile will give a detailed, continuous feedback
 highlighting the slightest flaw that they can spot. As the student becomes
 aware of dozens of errors they need to fix, they’d feel that the lesson fee is
 justifiable and so they book more classes. Gallwey uses the same approach in
 his early days as a tennis coach. Over time, he saw that when he stepped
 back and gave his students less feedback, they improved faster. Players
 would correct obvious mistakes without any guidance. They knew the
 correct way of playing tennis. They just needed to overcome the habits of
 the mind getting in the way. Gallwey’s insight does not just apply to tennis, but
 that individuals generally did have the answers to their own problems within
 themselves. 
Consider a manager who feels the need to constantly micromanage their
 employees and direct every detail of their work, not allowing any autonomy or
 flexibility. As a result, the employees lose interest in ever taking initiative or
 directing their own work. Instead of getting the perfect work they want, the
 manager receives lackluster efforts.

 Employee Rewards?
 An employee reward system is a motivation tactic
 organizations use to help their staff feel encouraged
 to complete high-quality work.  
Companies may often use rewards as extra
 encouragement by supplementing their employee's
 salaries.  Employees may also earn other tangible or
 monetary rewards separate from their paycheck.
 Initiatives on recognition are worthwhile since they emphasize the
 positives, sending employees a clear message that what they're
 doing matters. When you reward your employees who have exhibited
 exemplary performance with what they want, they will become more
 focused and motivated to do better.

 tool used to reward milestones and accomplishments of specific results, whether by
 a group or by an individual. 
Incentive is a variable pay, not a fixed benefit, and is based on pay for performance
 philosophy. The spirit of giving is hinged on the achievement of the bottomline
 target, that is, Net Income After Tax (NIAT). 
Explain how the incentive scheme works, including the eligibility requirements and the
 level of performance that is expected of them for them to reap the reward
 Explain that incentive is a variable pay; it is not a fixed benefit
 Conduct regular check-ins with your team to gauge their satisfaction with the program
 Express appreciation towards your team and to individual members for their contribution 
Provide feedback to top management of how the plan is working
 Leaders play a significant role in sustaining employee engagement and motivation.  As a
 leader, you should know what motivates and inspires your people that lead them to
 achieve significant results for the team and the organization. 
Leaders should work hand-in-hand with HR in understanding the principles and objectives
 of the company’s incentive program.  As a leader, you should be able to provide a clear and
 concise communication to your team about the incentive program in a way that will make
 them see how they will benefit financially from the success of the company.

What is
 Employee Benefits?
 Employee Benefits?
 Employee benefits are any benefits provided to
 employees in addition to their base salaries and
 wages.  Simply put, any non-wage benefit offered to
 an employee, either mandatory or voluntary, can be
 classified as an employee benefit.
 Some employee benefits are required by law. While
 additional benefits beyond the requirements are often
 called perks or fringe benefits.
 Offering an attractive benefits package is one of the most
 effective ways of attracting and retaining employees as it
 shows your organization's worth and increases morale.
 In a study conducted by the Society of Human Resource
 Management (SHRM), it was found that 92% of employees say
 that their benefits are important for their overall job
 satisfaction.  While a survey of job seekers shows that 63%
 pay attention to what benefits a company offers.  This means
 that offering benefits, and listing them in your job ads, is an
 integral part of successful hiring efforts.
 These benefits may include paid time off, health insurance, 
retirement benefits, education loan, other loans (house loan,
 vehicle loan etc) as well as flexible alternative arrangements.
 Ultimately, the company's benefits package can be a reflection
 of its values as it sends a message about the organization's
 beliefs and recognizes the employees' needs outside of the
 workplace and in support of their overall wellbeing.

Employee Discipline
 Employee Discipline
 Employee discipline refers to the regulations or
 conditions that are imposed on employees by
 management in order to either correct or prevent
 behaviors that are detrimental to an organization.    
Employee discipline should be positive and
 should contribute to a safe and pleasant work
 environment for everyone.  
The purpose of employee discipline is not to embarrass or
 degrade an employee. The purpose is to ensure that an
 employee performs in a manner that is deemed
 acceptable by the organization.  The focus is not on
 punishment and consequences, but rather on plans for
 improvement and growth.  
An effective discipline policy gives employees the
 opportunity to improve and develop as they address and
 correct their mistakes with the ultimate goal of becoming a
 valuable, contributing member of the workforce. At the
 same time, it protects the employers from possible legal
 case brought about by a termination or adverse
 employment decision by ensuring they have proper
 documentation and by remaining fair in their decisions. 
This promotes a fair workplace where a standard
 process and documentation is being followed that helps
 to avoid any biases or discrimination.

 Disciplining employees is one of the most difficult part of managing human resource. 
It is important to note though that the role of disciplining does not only rest upon
 the HR professionals.  Discipline is, first and foremost, a line function. It is the role of
 the leaders to ensure that the rules and regulations that govern the standards of
 behavior or conduct in an organization are well communicated and properly
 implemented. 
In order to effectively manage employee discipline, leaders should be: 
fully conversant of the company rules and regulations and disciplinary procedure
 in place, particularly going through the due process 
keep people up to date when changes in policies and procedures are made
 inform employees regarding acceptable and unacceptable behavior and knows
 when an employee is deviating
 capable of preventing deviations from policies
 remain impartial, fair, and consistent

 must at all times be administered in

 explained and clarified to the erring

 Cases leading to dismissal as a

 DISCIPLINARY ACTION
  Written Warning - often the first step to correct
 performance or behavioral issue(s) when a situation cannot
 be addressed by mere counselling
  Suspension - used to allow employees an opportunity to
 consider their commitment to correcting a behavior
 problem. Suspensions are used to correct behaviors that
 are more severe and would greatly affect operations and
 workplace harmony.
  Dismissal - considered as the last option, an employee’s
 employment maybe terminated for cause due to a very
 serious or severe violation of the Code of Conduct and
 Workplace Discipline.
 It is the policy of the company that any conduct or behavior
 which interferes with or negatively affects employment may
 lead to disciplinary action ranging from written warning to
 termination of employment.  Once the facts are gathered, the
 appropriate action will be determined, as outlined below:

 UNAUTHORIZED ABSENCES (AWOL)
 Regular attendance and punctuality is expected from all
 employees. In the event of unauthorized absences, the
 following are expected to be accomplished by the leader
 or immediate superior:
 1.
 2.
 3.
 Ensure that all communication channels are exhausted
 to contact the employee and gain information on the
 current situation and welfare of the employee and the
 reason for the absence.
 If warranted, the immediate superior must initiate the
 disciplinary process in case the employee does not
 have a valid reason for the absence.
 In the event that all communication channels are already
 exhausted, the immediate superior must report the
 absence to their HR Business Partner for the
 processing of the Return to Work Order to be sent
 through registered mail on the last known address of
 the employee.
 PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION
 In cases warranting termination of employment, the
 employee may be put on preventive suspension during the
 course of investigation, until a decision has been reached. A
 preventive  suspension not exceeding thirty (30) days
 may be implemented if the concerned employee’s
 presence in the Company premises poses a serious
 danger to life and property or if his presence is viewed as
 a threat to the objectivity of the ongoing investigation or
 would intimidate other  concerned employees.
 CLEANSING PERIOD
 Cleansing period refers to the period of time required from an
 infraction record to be “cleansed” and the employee’s
 discipline record is reset to“zero”.  The clearing period is one
 year from the date the violation was committed. Any
 repetition of the same violation within the clearing period will
 merit an imposition of corrective action following the
 progressive discipline schedule.

 lead to dismissal or the allegation is a Class 2 violation (or higher) of
 our Code of Conduct, or in the event that there is not enough
 information or facts to make an objective decision, an administrative
 hearing must be called for to ensure that the employee is given due
 process and a thorough investigation is done.
 The HR Business Partner, will lead the investigating committee which
 may include the supervisor or manager of the employee, union officer
 or representative, supervisor or manager from other departments.
 Depending on the level of the employee and the gravity of the offense,
 higher levels of authority may be included.
 After concluding the investigation, the committee must deliberate on
 the results of the investigation, agree on the next course of action and
 the immediate superior must issue the notice of decision to the
 employee.

OFFBOARDING
 OFFBOARDING
 Offboarding is the process of disengaging an employee from their position within the
 organization, which may be due to resignation, termination, or retirement. Offboarding
 manages the employee experience at the end of their tenure with the organization,
 covering all the necessary steps to successfully part ways with the employee. This ensures
 a smooth transition for both the company and the exiting employee. Thus, it is important to
 have a standardized offboarding process to maintain a good relationship with the exiting
 employees.

 Your role as Leader:
 Help the employee transition
 out of the company and offer
 closure, ideally in a way that
 allows them to feel
 supported.
 Ensure that the exiting
 employee receives a
 standardized offboarding
 process where all the necessary
 documents and processes are
 provided
 Make sure the departing
 employee feels appreciated for
 their contributions to the
 company.
Employees signify their intention to leave by filing for a request to leave the
 company. 
Employees may voluntarily separate themselves from the company, retire, be
 terminated or retrenched. It is important to identify the reason for separation, to
 properly tailor the process to the exiting employee.
 This is the interview where the Human Resource Staff inquires further on the
 employee’s reason for leaving and overall experiences in the company.
 Employees must secure the necessary documents to ensure their smooth
 transition out of the company. These may include updating government
 documents, computation of benefit packages, retirement packages and the return
 of company equipment. 
The Employee Offboarding Process may vary in different companies, depending on
 the different programs and policies in effect. However, the process mainly consists of: 
1.   Filing for Separation Request
 2.  Exit Interviews
 
3. Documentation

 An employee decides to leave the company for
 whatever reason.  As a policy, FSI requires a resigning
 employee to tender his/her resignation letter at least
 30 days before the effective date. This allows the
 company to find a suitable replacement for the
 employee to ensure smooth transition or turnover of
 responsibilities. The period of notice may be
 shortened provided it is approved by the manager.
 As a leader, it is your responsibility to immediately
 endorse the employee's resignation letter to the
 HRBP, or to at least give an advance information
 once an employee notifies you of his/her intention to
 leave. This is to ensure proper management of the
 offboarding process.

 thirty (30) days before the date of retirement.
 He/She must accomplish the Retirement Application Form (RAF).

 due notice shall no longer apply.
 Note: The retirement benefit provided by FSI is separate and
 distinct from the retirement benefit of SSS and PAG-IBIG. However,

 It is the termination of employment initiated by the employer through
 no fault of and without prejudice to the employees. The act of
 dismissing employees is governed by Article 283 of the Labor Code
 under Authorized Causes for termination of employment. It is
 undertaken to prevent substantial and serious losses that can be
 caused by any of the following:
 periods of business recession
 industrial depression
 seasonal fluctuations
 lack of work
 considerable reduction on the volume of the business
 In order to legally retrench employees, the employer must serve
 written notices to both the employee and DOLE at least 30 days prior
 to the intended date of termination. The employer must use fair and
 reasonable criteria in selecting employees to be dismissed, such as
 less preferred status, efficiency rating, and seniority (LIFO rule).
 Separation pay of the affected employee shall be equivalent to one
 (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of
 service, whichever is higher.

 Redundancy
 Redundancy is a condition which exists where the
 services of an employee are in excess of what is
 reasonably demanded by the actual requirements of the
 organization. This means that the position has become a
 duplication as a result of operational changes in the
 business such as: 
acquisition of new technology and/or equipment
 installation of labor-saving device
 overhiring of workers
 general decline of the business
 Separation pay of the affected employee is equivalent to
 one (1) month pay or one month for every year of
 service, whichever is higher.

The Exit Interview 
The Exit Interview
 The Exit Interview (EI) is an essential tool in
 identifying hidden challenges and
 opportunities that may contribute to
 increasing a company’s competitive edge.
 Moreover, valuing an exiting employee’s views
 may support overall employee knowledge
 transfer and engagement.

 DID YOU KNOW?
 Some experts argue that the best
 time to conduct the EI is halfway
 between the announcement of an
 intention to leave and the actual
 departure. They argue this is when
 initial rush of emotion of exiting the
 company has declined but before
 the employee has fully mentally
 checked out. Moreover, a less
 structured, positively-framed EI
 guide may provide a clearer picture
 of the information.
